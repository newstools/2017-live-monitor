While many men engage in the use of s_ex workers, a significant percentage finds the experience unsatisfying.
According to data from cheating website Victoria Milan, 47.3% of men internationally have made use of s_ex workers, and 23.3% are regulars – engaging “ladies of the night” at least once a week. It is pertinent to note that this cannot be extrapolated to men in general, but only of the men who form part of the cheating website’s subscribers.  The data, compiled from the site’s 6 097 male members showed that 35% of men who use sex workers do not enjoy the experience; rather do it out of “necessity”. The main reason men pay for se_x is the unavailability of a partner – 40.1% of men fell into this category – but 36.% used se_x workers to live out fantasies that the they could not with their current long-term partner. In terms of price, Victoria Milan said that men paid an average of €50 – €200 (R710 – R2840) or about €2 000 (R28 398) per year for a regular customer. Inequality and exploitation However, there are wild swings in price throughout the world. According to black market pricing index Havocscope, the cost for a se_x worker in India can range from $1 (R13) for an adult to $1 000 (R13 000) for a virg_in (read: underage girl). However, the rate in Germany is a flat $65 (R858) and a union minimum of $100 (R1321) in Switzerland. In the UK, a street s_ex worker can cost about $20 (R264). In SA, The Citizen reported that a Johannesburg se_x worker makes between R3 000 and R4 000 a month, charging R100 for straight se_x. Advocacy group SWEAT estimates that there are between 31 000 and 94 000 s_ex workers in Gauteng, with the majority being black South African women and a significant percentage from Zimbabwe. A Stellenbosch University Master’s thesis by Ferdinand Chemungha Mukumbang suggests that 1.51% of the adult female population in SA are involved in the se_x trade. The cheating website found that 80% of men will book a s_ex worker for one hour to “get it over and done with as quickly as possible”. And 50.1% of men find the experience unsatisfying because the prostitute “lacked enthusiasm”, and 26.3% said the escort was less attractive than her picture suggested.
