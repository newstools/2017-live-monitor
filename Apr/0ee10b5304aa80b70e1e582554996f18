A prisoner serving 23 years for ra_pe has won R7m in the national lottery. Mbongiseni Nzama, 52, was jailed for 23 years at Westville Prison in 2010. The matter has forced the department of correctional services to initiate an inquiry on how the prisoner managed to play lotto from behind bars. Current suspicions suggest he sent a prison guard to play for him. Nzama was convicted of ra_ping a 60-year-old woman in a park in the city, after a series of crimes which included one ra__pe, two attempted ra_pes and three indecent assaults. According to LiveMonitor, Nzama began a series of s_ex attacks while he was still in his 20s and was sentenced to a total of 18 years between 1973 and 1987. A Prison Service spokesman confirmed last night that a prisoner had won the lottery. He said: “We are aware a prisoner has participated in the lottery and we understand that he has won a substantial amount.” However, it was not clear if the prisoner will be given his winnings considering the fact that he broke the rules.
