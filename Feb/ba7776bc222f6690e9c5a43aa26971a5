FNB is going to be paying back its clients 10 thousand rand each in a course of 2 years after years of insane charges that cannot be explained. The supreme court ordered FNB to start paying back clients who have used the bank for over 10 years, R10 000 each and a public apology for the unfairly high charges. This came after a number of clients complained about high charges which triggered an investigation by the Reserve Bank. The Reserve Bank filed a report earlier this month in the Supreme court and FNB was found guilty of ripping off its clients with their high fees on everything.
After the news went public a few customers who used the bank for a very long time came forward. ‘I thought I was the only one being robbed by FNB’ said Joel Dube a farm worker. ‘My boss pay me R990 and I can only withdraw R650 and the rest goes to bank charges’. Another woman also said she think R10 000 is not enough for her loss and pain caused by FNB in the past years up to now. Source : Online ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
