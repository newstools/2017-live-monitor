An  lecturer the University of Pretoria was accused of failing female students who refused to succumb to his s_exual advances. His bubble burst when a girl, who had been failing his course – because she refused to have se_x with him – planned with her boyfriend to set him up. In a report seen by LiveMonitor, one student who witnessed the whole frenzy said ” The 2nd year student in question has been in his class since 2014. He was on her case up till yesterday. She decided to set him up, when he requested to come to her room. She arranged with some of her male friends and they hid in her toilet. The lecturer came to the room and she decided to play along and he stripped down for her ready for action. The guys came out of the toilet and instructed him to remain that way and they took a nu_de picture of him. Innocent students tears and prayers have been answered and we need a serious disciplinary action against him. He has been going scot free all this years.” Source : Online !
