A homeless woman claims she has been impregnated by no other than Jacob Zuma himself. The woman has been arrested by security agents after causing a ruckus and Nkandla has been obsessive about letting the world know that she is allegedly pregnant with the president of the Republic. The 38-year old woman was seen loitering around Nkandla for the past weeks, trying repeatedly and incessantly to jump over fences and walls at night, and being chased off by police officers more then three times without ever getting caught. The woman, that obviously has some mental issues, has been described by security agents for the past weeks as “saying she had to meet Jacob Zuma immediately and had terrific news for him but couldn’t tell us what”
It seems she might have been squatting the area for sometime as Nkandla gardeners have been complaining about finding human feces at different places in the bushes and flowers of the area. If true, this news comes at an embarrassing time for the Zuma family. Jacob Zuma had no comments about the scene, but a spokesman for the Zuma family  assured us that “he hopes this woman gets help soon and that she is unharmed”. Source : Online !
