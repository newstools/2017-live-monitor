THE little baby girl slept between her mum and dad, safe and warm, but death s cold grip was waiting next to the bed.When the mum woke up last Thursday morning, her baby wasn t in bed next to her.To her horror, she found her eight-month-old girl head down and dead in the family s pee bucket! The tragedy happened in Alexandra, northern Joburg.The heartbroken mum of three, Mary Dladla (28), said: This tragedy haunts me every day. I can barely sleep or eat. How Sphesihle fell into the bucket is still a mystery to me. I didn t hear single cry from her. I believe she might have moved during her sleep and fallen into the 20 litre bucket. She sleeps with me and her dad every night. She said the bucket stood at the side of the bed.Mary woke up and found the head of her baby in the bucket and the baby s clothes wet. I am torn apart. I believe that my daughter s spirit was abducted and will not find peace until it rests. Mary said that she loved her daughter and was still trying to come to terms with the loss. A mother should not bury her children. No parent should go through this horrific experience. I feel so empty and hopeless. Life s unfair. She was a gentle, sweet soul. Online! comments
