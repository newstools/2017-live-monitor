“YES, I had s_ex with my 11-year-old daughter because my culture compels me to do so!”This was the shocking statement made by a father as community members bayed for his blood. “Before she gets married or has a relationship with anyone, my culture compels me to be the one she sleeps with first,” he told a group of angry residents. The 41-year-old man was arrested while trying to flee his home in Dark City extension outside Thulamahashe, Mpumalanga on Sunday. He appeared in the Mhala Magistrates Court on Monday and was kept in custody. He will appear in court again today. He was not asked to plead to the charges. The ra_pes were discovered when village women questioned the child about her bulging belly and breasts at a communal tap where she had gone to fetch water. She claimed that her dad had been forcing himself on her for months. Angry residents stormed the man’s home, and he was rescued by cops. The girl’s stepmum (40) said her husband would leave the bedroom to watch TV, even at midnight! She said she would often find him in the sitting-room with the girl sitting on his thighs. Source : Online ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
