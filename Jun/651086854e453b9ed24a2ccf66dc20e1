The family of Yizo Yizo star Christopher &#8220;Gunman&#8221; Kubheka want answers after he was found hanging in his home in Soshanguve, north of Pretoria, on Monday. Though police have opened an inquest docket after his customary wife of eight years Cynthia Khumalo discovered his lifeless body, his family said they were confused by the manner in which he died.&#8220;We are confused but we don&#8217;t want to speculate. All we want is answers. The fact that he was found hanging from a burglar door is strange.&#8220;He left a suicide note but his wife said she did not read it [before] it was taken by the police. All we know is that at the end of the note he said we should call his aunt Busi, and [he] wrote down her contact details,&#8221; said his close friend Thami Madondo.He said Gunman apparently overdosed on pills before the alleged hanging. The aunt, Busi Kubheka, said her nephew had called her in the morning but did not tell her that there was something bothering him.&#8221; When I called him back he said he wanted to come back home. He told me that he was going to take his pills but did not specify for what. I then called my sister asking her to call him because I could feel he was not well,&#8221; said Kubheka.She said the family were taking the news badly. &#8220;He came to visit home for a couple of days last week and went back to Soshanguve on Friday. He did not show signs that there was something wrong.&#8220;I collapsed when I heard the news that he was dead. We are shattered.&#8221;Madondo said he and Gunman, 48, were like brothers.&#8220;He told me about his problems. I am still wondering what might have been bothering him to even think of taking his own life.&#8220;The wife said she left him at home and [that] they did not fight about anything,&#8221; said Madondo.His 27-year-old son Nkosana Kubheka said his father was always happy. &#8220;Even when you do something to him, he was a forgiving person and would tell you to leave it. He had a strong character,&#8221; he said.Gunman shot to fame with the SABC1&#8217;s award-winning drama Yizo Yizo in the 1990&#8217;s. It was in this controversial drama where he earned himself the nickname, which he popularly became known by.He also acted in Zone 14, Gold Diggers, Vat &#8216;n Sit and AboMzala.Police spokeswoman Captain Rheineth Motlana said an inquest docket had been opened and autopsy results were not available yet.Source : Online! comments
