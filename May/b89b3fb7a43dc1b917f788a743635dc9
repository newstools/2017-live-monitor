THE mum of Karabo Mokoena was in a state of despair when she arrived at the Johannesburg Magistrates Court today. There the heartbroken woman would be facing the man accused of brutally killing her daughter. The 27-year-old man was arrested yesterday after the burnt body of his 22-year-old ex-girlfriend was found by police in a veld in Lyndhurst, Joburg on 29 April. Karabo had been reported missing the day before. Karabo’s mum wept while she made her way around the courthouse surrounded by a crowd of relatives and friends. Wearing a black dress with a red shawl over her shoulders, she focused her bloodshot eyes on the floor as a relative comforted her. Some of Karabo’s relatives and friends consoled each other, while journalists camped outside the court room, waiting for the case docket to arrive from the cop shop so the hearing could begin. A handful of women wearing EFF clothes were also present. Yesterday afternoon, the family went to the mortuary to identify Karabo’s body. It had been burnt beyond recognition. Source : Online !
