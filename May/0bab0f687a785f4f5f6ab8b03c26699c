The family of a woman who was murdered, allegedly by her boyfriend, is meeting with Sandton police for details of what happened. They say they were told the boyfriend was arrested after admitting to killing Karabo Mokoena. The 22-year-old was reported missing in April. The family, including Mokoena’s mother and uncle, have visited the Sandton police station to obtain details. The uncle Tshepo Mokoena says although the victim’s body was badly burnt, they have accepted that it is her. “We have looked at the body; of course you know your child, the mother knows her child and for the mere fact that he has confessed, saying he dumped the body somewhere. Indeed, when we went there, the body was found.” He says the suspect led the police to the discovery of the body after apparently confessing to killing her, moving her body out of a residential complex using a laundry bin and later dumping her in Bramley. The boyfriend is expected to appear in court soon.  Source : Online ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
