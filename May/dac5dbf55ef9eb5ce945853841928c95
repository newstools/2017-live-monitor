THE cops in Sunnyside, Pretoria, have arrested a couple after they found them bonking in a car.
Police arrested the naked couple on Friday for poking and also allegedly attempting to bribe a local officer with R200. The suspects were spotted by two constables who were on patrol at an intersection previously identified as a hijacking hotspot, spokesperson Captain Daniel Mavimbela said in a statement on Monday. When the constables approached the Audi A2, they found a 33-year-old man engaging in sexual activity with a 27-year-old woman, Mavimbela said. When the couple realised that they had been caught by police officers, the man reportedly offered a R200 as a bribe.The officers refused the payment and waited for the couple to get dressed, before taking them to the local police station, Mavimbela said. The suspects are expected to appear in the Pretoria Magistrateâ€™s Court on charges of bribery and public indecency. Source : News24 ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
