The feud between a woman known as Buhle Mkhize and Norma Gigaba took another unexpected turn after a Facebook page pretending to belong to Buhle went viral. The page, which carried Buhleâ€™s name and picture, hurled razor-sharp insults at Norma and threatened to leak nude videos of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba.  The page also posted a screenshot it claimed showed Malusi begging Buhle for forgiveness.   A Twitter account set up in the name of Buhle then distanced itself from the page and warned fans not to be duped. Source : Online !  These content links are provided by Content.ad.
