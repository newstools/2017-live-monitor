It is usually assumed that a womanâ€™s lib-ido automatically decreases over time, through no fault of anyone, but this is not necessarily true. There are a few situations that will cause a woman to lose her l_ibido.
Considering these things could help you maintain a healthy s_ex drive and a fantastic s_ex life. 1. S_exual discomfort:
It is obvious that anyone will be disinterested in something that is not comfortable for them. If s_ex hurts you or you experience discomfort, it will surely make you lose interest, which will gradually kill your s_ex drive. 2. Diseases:
Some non-se_xual diseases such as arthritis, cancer, diabetes, high blood pressure, coronary artery disease and neurological diseases could negatively affect your se_x drive. 3. Fatigue:
Most South Africans believe that once a woman has babies, she loses interest in se_x. This is not simply a biological response. The reason her s_ex drive might decrease could be due to the exhaustion of waking up multiple times a night, stress of caring for a new baby, etc. When you are spending hours caring for a baby, it could be hard to feel se_xy. 4. Pregnancy and breastfeeding:
Hormone changes during pregnancy, just after having a baby and during breast-feeding can put a damper on s_exual desire. Some women are also affected by the way their body looks and this will make them self conscious. 5. Relationship issues:
Things like unresolved conflicts with your partner, poor communication and betrayal after infidelity can kill your s_ex drive. 6. Psychological issues:
Stress, poor body image, low self esteem and history of s_exual abuse may cause a woman to feel less inclined to have or enjoy s_ex. Source : Online ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
