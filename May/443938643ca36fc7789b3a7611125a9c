A Pretoria man thought it was a good idea to seal his wife’s va_gina with super glue as he was going away for a few days on a business trip, reports LiveMonitor. The 33-year-old man was brought forth before the court after his wife was rushed off to the emergency room and suffered medical complications and excruciating pain. He confessed to the judge that he was guilty of gluing her ge_nitals but only because he believed she had adulterous ideas after he found out she had liked a post of his 12-year-old cousin on Facebook. He also showed a selfie of her she had posted on her Facebook account. The man was brought before the court after accusations by the wife’s family of damaging her reproductive organs and risking to make her infertile.
According to Judge Melusi Zungu , the husband did unjustly bring harm to his wife, although his reasons were “well-intentioned” but put into action in an “awkward way” he said. Also, the judge pointed out that, after going through the evidence and photos the husband had brought to court, the suffering was in part justified. The husband was sentenced to pay R4 000 and prevented to use any sort of glue or adhesive on his wife ever again. Source : Online ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
