However, as the choreographed dance routine reached a summit and, the trio meant to do the popular vosho dance sequence when an object fell from Zodwa’s undergarments. The embarrassed matric student tried to pick it up before anyone noticed it but it was too late as the students had seen it. On coser inspection, it was discovered the item was a chicken foot with some muthi sprinkled on it.
