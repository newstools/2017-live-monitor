A motorist who seemed to be possessed shocked motorists in the CBD when she unashamedly took off her clothes and started bathing in the street. What started off as a normal day for commuters had a sudden twist of events when the woman did the solo show. The woman had found a blocked drain in the street at a robot and used it as a basin to have a bath. She did not worry about the probing eyes as she continued her bathing business. At one point, the person taking the video asks another woman if the bather is mentally disturbed to which the woman asked replies and says she is perfectly fine. How the woman ended up in the street or where she comes from remains a mystery. A member of the community policing forum said they once took the woman away but she still comes back to take a bath at her favorite spot. But an eye witness said she recognised her from the location and had a spell cast on her after she was caught sleeping with someone’s husband. “I know her. She has gained weight now but she got mad after she was caught with someone’s husband”, said the source The police said they would keep and eye. “Public indecency is illegal. We will see if we can arrange the necessary help for her”, said one police woman. Source : LiveMonitor ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
