The short man, who was in South Africa to discuss a movie deal decided to go ekasi to have a feel of township lifestyle but regretted the move after some nyaope guys pounced on him and stole his possessions. One of the five men who attacked Kevin Hart is believed to have punched him 8 times in the face, leaving him with a badly bruised face. Kevin is not a stranger to being mugged.
