The past week has been controversial nd highlighted the extent in which Mzansiâ€™s school kids have become extreme. Everyone has heard about the video and showing school kids doing adult stuff and many have been appaled. The police have even issued a warning against spreading the footage and that one risks jail term if found distributing or in possession of the footage. LiveMonitor did a break search on current school trends and managed to unearth a disturbing pattern that shows students engaged in risky behavior.  And this one left us speechless. What are they trying to do. Strike?  And this one seems to be bored of her lessons.  A little action never hurt.  Source : LiveMonitor ! These content links are provided by Content.ad.
